**************************************************************************************************



Setup time: about 15-25 minutes depending on your Hubitat skills.



PREREQUISITES
==============
Some technical skills & manual tasks are required to setup your Nest devices under Hubitat as the Nest Web APIs used
are not the "official" ones and don't have an oAuth flow (see LOGIN INFO For NEst or Google Account users below).


- a) [Nest] Your Nest products fully operational and connected to Nest Home via the internet

    Please note that all Nest thermostat devices are supported <b>except</b> the Nest thermostat E in the UK (with the heat link).      
    <b>Next Cams & Door Bells, and the Nest Secure Alarm are not supported. </b>  
    
- b) [Nest] <b>Nest setup completed for your Nest devices under your Nest Primary account  (don't use any Nest secondary accounts for the integation with hubitat!!) 



LOGIN INFO REQUIRED FOR NEST ACCOUNT Users (Not migrated to a Google account) 
=============================================================================

* <b> Once you log in to your Nest account as described in the steps below, please keep the connection active to avoid any disconnect in Hubitat (i.e., do not log off, but you can close your browser and even turn off your desktop/mobile), and don't change your Nest account password or 2FA settings.</b>

* Google recently introduced reCAPTCHA when logging to Nest. That means username and password cannot be used directly any more. 
Instead, you have to obtain  `user_id ` and  `access_token` for your account by logging in manually. 

* For some visual guidelines, refer to screenshots in the link below

https://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=My_NextServiceMgr#Issue_.2314:_My_Next_devices_are_not_updating_or_my_auth_tokens_are_lost

________________________________________________________________________
<b>7 Steps for Nest users who have NOT migrated to a Google account:</b>
________________________________________________________________________


1. [Chrome] To do that, open `developer tools` in your Chrome browser, switch to the `Network` tab, 

2. [Chrome] Hit `preserve Logs` in the Network tab 

3. [Chrome] Log in to home.nest.com and look for the request similar to https://home.nest.com/session?_=157XXXXXX. 

4. [Chrome] You can use the filter "session" to get the exact info needed.

5. [Chrome] You will find `user_id` and `access_token`  in the response to the request.

6. [Chrome->IDE] MyNestManager- Copy over the Nest login information to the corresponding nest_* fields in the header (IDE) for MyNextManager, refer to step 2g) below at https://github.com/yracine/device-type-myNext/blob/master/README.md#2-create-a-new-smartapp-mynextmanagerv2.

In the header (code) section of MyNextManager, you will see "INSERT THE NEST LOGIN INFORMATION BELOW".

FYI,the login info for Nest account users looks like the following (your Nest user id will be different):

nest_user_id=4783742 nest_access_token=b.4783742.xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

[Hubitat IDE] MyNestManager- header (code) section: After copying and pasting the login info, press "save" to save the code with your Nest login variables. Don't insert anything in the google section.
Do not copy the double quotes from the nest login information in the variables.
______________
<b>Notes:</b>
______________

* If you lose your auth tokens, then you'd need to redo the steps above and copy over the new nest access_token back to the Hubitat IDE. You can then reset the Nest connection by executing MyNextManager under Automation/Smartapps in the Samsung connect app by pressing "Next" till "Done").

* You don't need to re-install the devices, just reset the Nest connection.


LOGIN INFO REQUIRED FOR GOOGLE ACCOUNT USERS (MIGRATED NEST USERS)
===================================================================


______________
<b>Notes:</b>
______________

* <b> Once you log in to your Nest account as described in the steps below, please keep the connection active to avoid any disconnect in Hubitat (i.e., do not log off, but you can close your browser and even turn off your desktop/mobile), and don't change your Google account password or 2FA settings.</b>

* If you lose your auth tokens, then you'd need to redo the steps below and copy over the new google cookie and issue_token_url back to the Hubitat IDE. You can then reset the Nest connection by executing MyNextManager by pressing "Next" till "Done").

* You don't need to re-install the devices, just reset the Nest connection.

<b>13 Steps for users who have migrated to a Google account:</b>
______________________________________________________________

Similar as the Nest account user, open `developer tools` in your Chrome browser,switch to the `Network` tab, hit `preserve Logs`.
For some visual guidelines, refer to screenshots in the link below

https://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=My_NextServiceMgr#Issue_.2314:_My_Next_devices_are_not_updating_or_my_auth_tokens_are_lost

The values of `issue_token` and `cookie` are specific to your Google Account. To get them, follow these steps (only needs to be done once, as long as you stay logged into your Google Account). 

1. [Chrome] Open a Chrome browser tab in Incognito Mode (or clear your cache).
2. [Chrome] Open Developer Tools (View/Developer/Developer Tools).
3. [Chrome] Click on 'Network' tab. 
4. [Chrome] Make sure 'Preserve Log' is checked.
5. [Chrome] In the 'Filter' box, enter `issueToken`
7. [Chrome] Go to `home.nest.com`, and click 'Sign in with Google'. Log into your account.
8. [Chrome] One network call (beginning with `iframerpc`) will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on it.
9. [Chrome] In the Headers tab, under General, copy the entire `Request URL` (beginning with `https://accounts.google.com`, ending with `nest.com`). This is your `"google_issue_token_url"` in the App Settings section of MyNextManagerV2 (ST IDE).Refer to https://github.com/yracine/device-type-myNext/blob/master/README.md#2-create-a-new-smartapp-mynextmanagerv2.
10. [Chrome] In the 'Filter' box, enter `oauth2/iframe`
11. [Chrome] Several network calls will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on the last `iframe` call.
12.[Chrome] In the Headers tab, under Request Headers, copy the entire `cookie` (usually it starts with `OCAK=...` or `SID=...` or `SMSV=...`  or with other values - **include the whole string which is several lines long and has many field/value pairs** - do not include the `cookie:` name). This google "cookie" needs to be copied over in the code (header) section of the MyNextManager smartapp  under the instructions saying 'INSERT GOOGLE LOGIN INFO BELOW'.  See https://github.com/yracine/device-type-myNext/blob/master/README.md#2-create-a-new-smartapp-mynextmanagerv2.
13. [Chrome->IDE]   MyNestManager- Make sure that the whole cookie from Google is contained in google_cookiep1.  There is no need to split the cookie anymore (the other google_cookie p2-p6 variables are used for backward compatibility. Please make sure to avoid inserting extra spaces or any other characters when you copy the google cookie as Google will not accept it and the list of devices will be empty.
14. [Hubitat IDE]  MyNestManager- After copying and pasting the login info, press "save" and "publish" at the right corner of the IDE to save the code with your variables.
be recognized (and your list of devices will be empty).

# 6) Use some of my smartapps (optional) - For all Nest users

Some complimentary smartapps at my github, refer to:

https://github.com/yracine/device-type-myNext/tree/master/smartapps

/****************************************************

<b>a) NestChangeMode</b>

/****************************************************

Change your Nest Away/Home settings according to your Hubitat location or  hello home mode.

/****************************************************

<b>b) NestGetTips/b>

/****************************************************

The smartapp allows the user to get comfort & energy tips based on his/her indoor/outdoor conditions at home.


/****************************************************

<b>c) TstatStateTriggerHA</b>

/****************************************************

The above smartapp allows a Hubitat user to trigger some switch(es) (turn on/off or flash) and/or trigger a hello phrase routine when the thermostat is cooling/heating/running the fan/or idle.


/****************************************************

<b>d) MonitorAndSetNestHumdity</b>

/****************************************************

The above smartapp allows a Hubitat user to trigger the humidifier/dehumidifier connected to Nest or some humdifier/dehumidifier switch(es) based on the indoor/outdoor conditions at your home in order to reach the target humidity level.

/****************************************************

<b>e) Zoning smartapps

/****************************************************


The following zoned Heating/cooling smartapps have many features to leverage your Nest Thermostat.

* User friendly Dashboard and workflow pages for easier setup  (i.e. Dashboard->GeneralSetup->RoomsSetup->ZonesSetup->SchedulesSetup-> NotificationSettings).
* Flexible schedule definition: you can define up to 12 schedules for your zones (mornings, weekdays, evenings, nights, weekends, etc.)
* Remote Sensors: choice of  temp calculation method (Average, Median, Minimum, Maximum, Heat/Min-Cool/Max) based on all room temp sensors inside the zone so that your heat/cool settings are adjusted at the main thermostat even if your rooms are far away. The average calculation is similar to the ecobee3's follow me feature with its remote sensors.
* For each schedule, Hubitat users can define the start & end times, the thermostat's heating/cooling setpoints (or climates for ecobee), the max temp adjustment based on the chosen calculation method (avg, median, min, max, etc.)
* You can set your schedules to run only for some routines/ST hello modes (ex. 'Away', 'Home', 'Night', or your own customized ones )
* For each schedule, you can assign the included zone(s) according to your own requirements (ex. Upstairs bedrooms, 1st level, basement, etc)
* You can define up to 8 zones for your home which can include up to 16 rooms
* Ability to set your smart thermostat to 'Away' or 'Present' based on all rooms' motion sensors
* Ability to set the thermostat's fanMode ('on', 'auto', 'circulate') during a specific schedule
* Ability to trigger the thermostat's fan based on some indoor temp differential. The temp differential can be customized for each schedule.
* Ability to adjust your main thermostat's settings (every 5 minutes) based on an outdoor temp sensor (optional)
* and many more features...
